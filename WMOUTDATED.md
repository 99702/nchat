WhatsApp / Whatsmeow Client Outdated
====================================
The [whatsmeow](https://github.com/tulir/whatsmeow) library is actively
developed to keep up with the official WhatsApp API. As such, the version used
by nchat may sometimes become outdated.

It is recommended to update nchat on regular basis (at least quarterly) to
reduce the risk of having issues.

If there is no newer stable nchat release available in
[Releases](https://github.com/d99kris/nchat/releases) then please report a bug.

As a workaround, building and installing latest nchat git master from source
may resolve the issue.
